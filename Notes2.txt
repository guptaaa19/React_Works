# props: Acronym for properties. They are just like passing normal arguments to a function.

# config driven ui: ui is driven by a config(data) which is controlled by backend. For eg: every city will have different offers and carousels based on the location.

frontend : ui layer + data layer 

# whenever you use map always have a key in it otherwise it will give error {index.js:1 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.}

react optimizes its render cycle

react says do not use index for keys since order is subject to change
