# My React Learnings!

# Parcel (Parcel i a beast!):
React does not do those things Parcel is doing:
- Dev Build
- Local Server
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algorithm : written in C++
- Cashing : Faster Build Experience (.parcel-cache)
- Image Optimization (one of the most expensive thing in your web browser is to load the images in your page)
- Minification of our file for production (in production build)
- Bundling
- Compression (remove all the white spaces)
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling : to support older browsers
- Diagnostics
- Error Handling
- HTTPs : gives a way to host our app on HTTPs also (just wow!)
- Tree Shaking (Algoritm) : remove unused code for you
- Different dev and prod. bundles
