# Hooks: 
- A normal js function given to us by react. 
- It is pre-built
- has some super-powers
- has some logic written behind the scenes
- is a utility fn given by react to us 

2 imp hooks :
useState() : Superpowerful state variables in react
useEffect() :

# whenever a state variables changes, react re-renders my components.

# REACT BEHIND THE SCENES:
Reconcilatoin Algorithm (React Fibre)

concept of virtual dom pre-existed but the react introduced efficient algorithm to effficient use in our application

# Virtual dom
- Not an actual dom
- Representation of actual dom
- It is normal js object

# Real dom
- They are tags in our return tag.

# github link : acdlite/react-fiber-architecture

# const [ listofRes, setListofRes ] = useState(reslist);
here we de-structuring the array on the fly
setListofRes: it is used to trigger the diff algorithm and re-render the UI (when any changes occur)

useState : Return an array

const arr = useState(reslist);
const [ listofRes, setListofRes ] = arr; //it will work

const listofRes = arr[0];
const listofRes = arr[1];
