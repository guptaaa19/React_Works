<!-- order of files matter alot 
for eg: if you cut paste the app.js in index.html and paste it above in the body then it will throw an error("react is not defined")
order of these files are always in sequence when they are imported -->


<!-- react is called library because it can work in the small portion of your existing app, it is just a js library, 
it is just js -->
