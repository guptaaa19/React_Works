# Ep0701:

dependency array : changes the behaviour of its render. using dependency array is optional.
if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render.
if empty dependency array => useEffect is called on initial render(just once).
if somethong inside dependency array => will be called only when the dependency changes or updates.
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("useEffect Rendered")
},
[btnNameReact]); 

# Ep0702: 
useState
- always call useState inside the body fn.
- used to create local state variables inside your functional components.
- always call them on the top.
- never use them inside in if-else, for loop and inside function (inside a condition)

# Ep0703:

createBrowserRouter: creates a routing configuration;
                    - takes in a list of path(it is nothing but an object)
configuration defines what will happen in a specific route. (what will happen when we will call about)

RouterProvider: will actually provide this routing configuration(appRouter) to our app 

# Ep0704:

Children Router: here the header always sticks on the top even when we navigate to different routes such as about, contactus etc.

Before children routing:
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        errorElement : <Error />
    },
    {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
    },
    {
        path: "/contact",
        element:  <ContactUs />,
    },
])

Outlet: it is a component, it will be filled with children acccording to what page we are on.Eg: if im on about then in Outlet /About will be filled. About component will replace Outlet acccording to the path.

In react, never ever use anchor tag, because whole page got refreshed(to make fastt transction, i want to navigate to a new page without even re-reloading it)
For this we will use Link of reacr-router-dom works same as of anchor tag, it does not refreshes the page. Its superfast.

React is called a single page as when we are switching from different routes, we are changing between differet components. While navigating we do not refreash our pages.

# There are two types of routing:
1. server-side
2. client-side : no network calls (which we are doing right now)


# Ep0705:{Another api for individual resturant}


Link is wrapper of anchor tag. spl type of link that keeps from refreshes. Behind the sceces link is anchor tag only.
